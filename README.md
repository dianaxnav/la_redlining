# Investigating the legacy of redlining in current environmental (in)justice

The purpose of this analysis is to investigate whether the effect of
redlining has far reaching impacts on not only the people in LA, but
bird conservation in the area as well. A recent study found that their
could be links to the way we view biodiversity because these redlined
neighborhoods are found to be the most undersampled. This could lead to
further consequences because most conservation efforts rely heavily on
data.
